**Note**

Summary
1. Use simple seq2seq model, with different structure for different problems
2. Got better results than n-gram
3. Still has some issues, for example, gives different answers to same question with different words.

Thoughts
1. in fact, it's not an answer to "question understanding"
2. we need a semantics model
3. this is a way to capture short context in several sentences.
